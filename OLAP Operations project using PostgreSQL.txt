1. Database Creation
a) Create the Database
CREATE DATABASE sales_analysis;

b) Create the sales_sample Table
CREATE TABLE sales_sample (
    Product_Id INT,
    Region VARCHAR(50),
    Date DATE,
    Sales_Amount NUMERIC
);


2. Data Creation
Insert Sample Data into the sales_sample Table
INSERT INTO sales_sample (Product_Id, Region, Date, Sales_Amount)
VALUES
(1, 'East', '2024-01-10', 1000),
(2, 'West', '2024-01-15', 1500),
(3, 'North', '2024-02-10', 1200),
(1, 'South', '2024-02-20', 1300),
(2, 'East', '2024-03-05', 1400),
(3, 'West', '2024-03-15', 1100),
(1, 'North', '2024-04-10', 1600),
(2, 'South', '2024-04-20', 1700),
(3, 'East', '2024-05-05', 1800),
(1, 'West', '2024-05-15', 1900);

3. Perform OLAP Operations
a) Drill Down: Analyze Sales Data at a More Detailed Level
This query drills down from the region level to the product level to understand sales performance.
SELECT Region, Product_Id, SUM(Sales_Amount) AS Total_Sales
FROM sales_sample
GROUP BY Region, Product_Id
ORDER BY Region, Product_Id;

b) Rollup: Summarize Sales Data at Different Levels of Granularity
This query performs a rollup to view total sales by region, summarizing from the product level.
SELECT Region, COALESCE(Product_Id, 'All Products') AS Product, SUM(Sales_Amount) AS Total_Sales
FROM sales_sample
GROUP BY ROLLUP (Region, Product_Id)
ORDER BY Region, Product;

c) Cube: Analyze Sales Data from Multiple Dimensions Simultaneously
This query uses the CUBE operation to explore sales data from different perspectives, such as product, region, and date.
SELECT COALESCE(Product_Id, 'All Products') AS Product,
       COALESCE(Region, 'All Regions') AS Region,
       COALESCE(Date, 'All Dates') AS Date,
       SUM(Sales_Amount) AS Total_Sales
FROM sales_sample
GROUP BY CUBE (Product_Id, Region, Date)
ORDER BY Product, Region, Date;

d) Slice: Extract a Subset of Data Based on Specific Criteria
This query slices the data to view sales for a particular region (e.g., 'East') or a specific date range.
SELECT *
FROM sales_sample
WHERE Region = 'East' AND Date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-03-31';

e) Dice: Extract Data Based on Multiple Criteria
This query dices the data to view sales for specific combinations of product, region, and date.
SELECT *
FROM sales_sample
WHERE Product_Id = 1 AND Region = 'East' AND Date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-05-31';
